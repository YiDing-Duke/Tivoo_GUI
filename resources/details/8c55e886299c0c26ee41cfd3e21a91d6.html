We will cover curriculum on the cardiovascular system (with a pig heart dissection!) in the fall. This is a one hour lunch with a local elementary school in Durham. Through this program, we hope to spark interest in the health sciences and encourage these young-ens to pursue higher levels of education.

Activities will include lunch, lecture, and small group activities.</p></div>
