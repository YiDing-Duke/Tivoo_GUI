<div><h1>ECE Seminar:  "Circuit Design in Nano-Scale CMOS Era:  Challenges & Opportunities"</h1><h3>Currin, Ellen</h3><p>Start Time: Tue Sep 27 14:00:00 EDT 2011</p><p>End Time: Tue Sep 27 15:00:00 EDT 2011</p><p>Description: CMOS technology has served as the foundation of modern electronics over the last 40 years. Relentless technology scaling has been the main growth engine in the semiconductor industry, bringing ever-increasing performance to the end-user while lowering product power and cost. But the miniaturization of CMOS transistors has led to increasing difficulties in achieving robust circuit design to meet high-volume manufacturing requirements as the feature size of the transistor is scaled down to the nano-regime. 

In this talk, the state of current CMOS technology scaling along with most recent technology innovations will be first discussed along with their impacts on circuit design. Then the presentation will focus on the scaling of several critical circuit areas, including SRAM and key analog circuit blocks. Some innovative design solutions will be discussed in addressing both low-power and high-performance requirements for future scaling.</p></div>
