Samuel Baron, 1960) ### "The Orion String Quartet is prized for its command of both the classical repertory and contemporary music by composers like Lowell Liebermann and Wynton Marsalis. Likewise, the distinguished woodwind soloists who compose Windscape - the Manhattan School of Music's ensemble-in-residence - draw insightful connections all over the musical map. 

In Durham, these institutions combine their forces in the landmark Art of the Fugue, where Bach elaborates a simple subject toward profound complexity without specifying any particular instrumentation. Samuel Baron's 1960 arrangement for string quartet, flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, and horn supplies 80 minutes of ravishing ensemble color to the intensely logical score.</p></div>
