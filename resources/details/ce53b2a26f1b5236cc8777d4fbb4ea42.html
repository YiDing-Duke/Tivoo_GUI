<div><h1>Durham, NC: Introducing Students to the Community in which We Live, Learn, and Serve</h1><h3>Wright, Kristin</h3><p>Start Time: Tue Sep 27 19:15:00 EDT 2011</p><p>End Time: Tue Sep 27 20:30:00 EDT 2011</p><p>Description: What role did Duke¿s Allen Building play in the Civil Rights History of Durham? What can we learn about Durham from 2010 Census data? In what ways do Duke¿s service-learning courses participate in Durham¿s Downtown Revitalization Projects?

These are only a few of the questions faculty might consider when orienting students to Durham. 

At this hands-on and interactive workshop, participants will learn about actual and virtual resources on Durham through a Durham Library Guide; be connected to their subject librarian for further development of course-specific resources; and share ideas about ways to orient students to our community.
